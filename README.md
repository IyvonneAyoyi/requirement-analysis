# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks,a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system will be created. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
